# Bankist-App-with-DOM

A banking site I created with a line by line trainer while learning DOM manipulation.

Codes that I learned while creating the site and that you can find in its content;

1) When clicking anywhere in the navigation, it goes to the relevant part of the page with a "smooth scroll" effect.
2) Window effect when clicking "Open account" at the top right and "Open your free account today!" at the bottom.
3) I created using Intersection Observer API is that the page loading when page is scrolled down.(Essential for fast-loading performance sites)
4) Tab effect you can see in the "Operations" section of the site.
5) And at the bottom of the page is the comment slider, which looks like an image slider.
